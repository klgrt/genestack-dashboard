# Genestack Dashboard

A Python dashboard for performing and visualizing bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell RNA-Seq, and single nucleus RNA-Seq analyses using Genestack ODM.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Seamless access to Genestack ODM data.
- **Analysis Tools**:
  - Bulk RNA-Seq analysis (differential expression, co-expression, pathway analysis).
  - Single-cell and single nucleus RNA-Seq analysis (clustering, classification, differential expression).
- **Visualization**:
  - Interactive plots (heatmaps, scatter plots, PCA, t-SNE/UMAP).
  - Gene expression visualization across samples/conditions.
  - Cell type composition and distribution.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Built-in statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA).
  - Multiple testing correction (Benjamini-Hochberg).
